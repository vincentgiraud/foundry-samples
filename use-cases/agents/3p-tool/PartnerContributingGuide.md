# 3p Tool Partner Contributing Guide

## Who should read this?
This contributing guide is designed for partners who want to bring their APIs as part of the **Azure AI Foundry Tool Catalog** so that customers can integrate your APIs with Azure AI Agent service through a tool to retrieve data or integrating with a workflow.

- `README.md` (required): follow this [template](./README_template_for_parter.md) as an example and this README file will serve as public documentation for help customers set up and use the tool with your API through Azure AI Agent service
  - The name, logo, and description in this README file will be used in the Azure AI Foundry Portal user experience and marketing materials.
  - It must include how customers set up an account with your API directly and your customer support contact or website.
  - Customers should be able to follow this README file and successfully use the tool with Azure AI Agent service.
- `sample code` (required): using at least one of the SDK below
  - (recommended) Python: [Azure AI Projects client library for Python | Microsoft Learn](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/overview/azure/ai-projects-readme?view=azure-python-preview#create-agent-with-openapi)
