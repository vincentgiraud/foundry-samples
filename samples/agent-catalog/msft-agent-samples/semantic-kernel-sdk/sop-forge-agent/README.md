# Standard Operating Procedure (SOP) Forge Agent 

## Overview 

SOP Forge agent converts any short demonstration video into a clean, production‑ready Standard Operating Procedure. 

It automatically transcribes the footage, detects each procedural step, selects clear images, and fills your preferred Markdown template, delivering a numbered, well‑formatted document that's ready for training and shop‑floor distribution.

The agent has the following capabilities:

* **Video Analysis**: Ingest a single video file, create a transcript, and segment the narrative into logical, ordered steps. 
* **Image Selection & Enhancement**: Extract key frames for each step for illustrative purposes. 
* **Markdown SOP Drafting**: Populate an SOP template with title, purpose, prerequisites, numbered instructions, embedded images with alt‑text, and an auto‑generated "Troubleshooting / FAQ" section.
* **Export**: Save a final Markdown file with images locally.

## Sample Data

Example of the Standard Operating Procedure generated by the agent is located in the [assets folder](assets/output/sample/). This response was generated from the [sample input video](assets/input/VideoExample480p.mp4).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

* [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

### Instructions

#### Step 1: Create Azure AI Content Understanding Resource

[Follow the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/content-understanding/how-to/create-multi-service-resource) to create an Azure AI Services resource that supports Content Understanding.

#### Step 2: Create Deployment Model

[Follow the official documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-foundry/quickstarts/get-started-playground#deploy-a-chat-model) to create an Azure AI Foundry model deployment.

#### (Optional) Step 3: Create Azure AI Agent Service Agent

*This step is optional. If you don't create an Azure AI Agent, the program will create one for you automatically.*

1. Follow the official [Azure AI Agent Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal) to create the claims analysis agent (a chat completion agent). 
2. In the **Instructions** box, paste the contents of [AgentInstructions.md file](assets/input/AgentInstructions.md).

#### Step 4: Configure `.env` File

Duplicate the `src/.env.example` file as `src/.env` and provide the required configuration.

#### Step 5: Install Required Modules

Run the following command to install modules used by the application:
