    - To provide video access either
      - Generate a [SAS token](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/storage/common/storage-sas-overview) to provide as a video URL directly to the agent
      - Tell the agent where your video is located locally (via file path) and the agent will handle uploading the video to the storage account and generating the url
  - **Azure CLI**: [Install](https://learn.microsoft.com/cli/azure/install-azure-cli) and authenticate using `az login`

### Setting up Azure AI Agent Service

Follow the [official Azure AI Agent Service documentation](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/agents/quickstart?pivots=ai-foundry-portal) quickstart. This guides you through creating a hub and project in the Azure AI Foundry Portal and deploying your model. Once completed, you'll have the necessary credentials to configure your environment variables in the next steps.

### Quickstart

1. Clone the repository and navigate to the `video-translation-agent` folder using the "cd" command in the terminal.

2. Create and activate a virtual environment:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use: .venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

4. Create a `.env` file based on the `.env.sample` provided:

```bash
cp .env.sample .env
```

5. Update the `.env` file.

### Running the Video Translation Agent

Start the agent with:

```bash
python template.py
```

The agent will guide you through the process of translating videos, providing helpful prompts for required information. To exit the agent at any time, simply type `exit` or `quit` in the console.

## Sample Data

### Video Requirements

- .mp4 format video file
- Less than 5 GB in size
- Shorter than 4 hours in duration
- Verify your [source and target languages are supported](https://learn.microsoft.com/azure/ai-services/speech-service/language-support?tabs=video-translation)

### Translation Management

Manage your translations with commands to:
- List all translations
- Get details about specific translations
- Create new iterations with customized subtitles
- Delete translations

### Translating a Video

```
You: I'd like to translate a video from English to Japanese
Agent: I can help you translate your video from English to Japanese. First, I need to know if you have a local video file on your computer or a URL to a video stored online.

You: I have a local file at C:\Videos\my_presentation.mp4
Agent: Great! I'll need to upload that file to Azure Blob Storage first so it can be processed.
[Agent uploads file]
Video uploaded successfully!
Access URL: https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/videos/my_presentation.mp4
Secure access URL (valid for 24 hours): https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/videos/my_presentation.mp4?sv=...

Now I need a few more details:
1. Would you like to use "PlatformVoice" or "PersonalVoice" for the translation? PlatformVoice is the standard option.
[...]
```


```
You: I need to translate our new training video from English to Spanish, French, and German for our international facilities. The video is hosted on our secure server.

Agent: I'd be happy to help translate your training video. Do you have a URL for the video, or is it stored locally on your computer?

You: It's available at https://yourstorageaccount.blob.core.windows.net/videos/my_training_video.mp4

Agent: Perfect. I'll use this URL directly for the translation process. Now I need some details for the translation:
1. Would you like to enable subtitles for accessibility?
2. How many speakers are in your video? This helps with speaker identification.

You: Yes, please enable subtitles. We have 2 speakers - a narrator and a demonstrator.

Agent: I'll set up the translations with subtitles and optimize for 2 speakers.

Starting translation process for all three languages:
- English → Spanish (es-ES): Processing...
- English → French (fr-FR): Processing...
- English → German (de-DE): Processing...
```

### Creating an Iteration with Custom Subtitles

```
You: I want to improve the subtitles for my translation
Agent: I can help you create a new iteration with custom subtitles. Do you have the Translation ID for the video?

You: Yes, it's 06202024123045_en-US_ja-JP_PlatformVoice
Agent: Great! Now I need the URL to your WebVTT subtitle file and the type of WebVTT file you're providing.
[...]
```

Would you like to get more details about any specific translation or perform any actions with these translations?
```

## ⚠️ Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:

- **Authentication Errors**: Ensure you're logged in with `az login` and have the proper permissions.
- **File Upload Issues**: Check your storage account name and permissions.
- **Translation Failures**: Verify your video format is supported and your Cognitive Services endpoint is correct.

### Logging Configuration

By default, logging is set to the ERROR level. If you need more detailed output for debugging or monitoring, you can adjust the logging level:

```bash
# Options include: DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL
export LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG  # On Windows, use: set LOG_LEVEL=DEBUG
```

You can also modify the logging configuration directly in the code by updating the `logging.basicConfig()` call in `template.py`:

```python
# Example: Change to INFO level logging with more detailed format
logging.basicConfig(
    level=logging.INFO,
    format='%(asctime)s [%(levelname)s] %(name)s: %(message)s',
    datefmt='%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S'
)
```
