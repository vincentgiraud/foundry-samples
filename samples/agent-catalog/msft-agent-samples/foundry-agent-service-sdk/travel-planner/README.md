# Travel Planner Agent

## Summary
The **Travel Planner Agent** is an AI-powered agent built using Azure AI Agent Service. It helps users receive up-to-date travel recommendations by leveraging both the **Bing Grounding Tool** and the **TripAdvisor API**. The agent summarizes relevant information clearly and offers to create a custom itinerary based on the user's travel duration.

## Use Cases
1. **Vacation Planning**: Travelers can get up-to-date suggestions on destinations, hotels, and activities.
2. **Business Travel**: Professionals receive efficient recommendations tailored to time-sensitive trips.
3. **Local Exploration**: Residents or tourists can find trending events, attractions, or day-trip ideas in their vicinity.

## Architecture Overview
The system consists of:
- An AI Agent created with Azure AI Agent Service using `gpt-4o` as the base model.
- A Bing Grounding Tool integrated via Azure Bing Account and connected to the agent.
- A TripAdvisor API tool integrated via OpenAPI.
- A Bicep template to automate provisioning of Azure resources.
