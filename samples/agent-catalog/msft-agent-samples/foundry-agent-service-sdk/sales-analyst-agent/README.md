## 💬 Example Agent Interactions

**User**: What were the total sales in Q4 2024 across the Pacific Northwest?  
**🔍 Agent Response**: File Search pulls data rows for Q4 2024 and region = Pacific Northwest; Code Interpreter sums total sales.

---

**User**: Can you compare average order value by region for last year?  
**🔧 Agent Response**: Code Interpreter calculates and visualizes average order value per region.

---

**User**: I just uploaded a new CSV file—can you check if there’s a drop in sales in Q1 2025 compared to Q4 2024?  
**🔍 Agent Response**: File Search locates relevant time periods, Code Interpreter computes and compares sales metrics.

---

**User**: Generate a quick summary of our revenue by product category for the last 6 months.  
**🔧 Agent Response**: Code Interpreter generates a table and pie chart based on filtered data.

## 🛠 Customization Tips

- **Connect to Live Data Sources**  
  Extend with connectors to Azure SQL, Power BI datasets, or Dynamics 365 for real-time reporting.

- **Enrich with Metadata Tags**  
  Pre-process uploaded files with tags (e.g., region, channel, product line) to improve retrieval accuracy.

- **Forecast with External Signals**  
  Integrate a market trends tool or embed economic indicators to improve forecasting reliability.

- **Add Executive Dashboard Mode**  
  Change the `system_message` to generate polished summaries suitable for leadership review.

- **Support for Multi-file Comparison**  
  Modify the tool logic to handle cross-file comparisons for multi-quarter or multi-region datasets.
