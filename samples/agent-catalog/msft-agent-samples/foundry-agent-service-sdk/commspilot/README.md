# CommsPilot Agent

## Summary
The CommsPilot Agent is an AI-powered communications assistant built using Azure AI Agent Service. It helps enterprise users compose high-quality, personalized, and professional emails by combining internal knowledge, real-time context, and publicly grounded data via Bing. The agent streamlines enterprise communication by handling formatting, tone, and relevant context with minimal input from the user.

## Use Cases
1. Context-Aware Email Drafting: Generate customer-ready responses using internal tools and documentation.
2. Public Information Integration: Enrich emails with publicly available facts using Bing grounding.
3. Brand-Aligned Formatting: Automatically apply formatting guidelines (headers, bullets, inline links, etc.).
4. Rapid Comms: Help support agents, product managers, and engineers respond faster and more consistently.
5. Multi-Tool Intelligence: Integrate outputs from internal tools and APIs (e.g., product APIs, support logs) to create unified responses.

## Architecture Overview
The system consists of:

- An AI Agent built using Azure AI Agent Service with gpt-4o as the base model.
- A Bing Grounding Tool for referencing publicly available content and insights.
- Internal data tools (e.g., API wrappers, logic apps) that provide customer-specific, account-specific, or enterprise-specific content.
- A custom system prompt designed to enforce formatting, tone, and response structure guidelines.

## Architecture Overview

CommsPilot Agent uses Azure AI Agent Service and is equipped with two main knowledge sources: internal documentation and external web grounding. It receives incoming support emails, drafts polished, context-aware replies, and sends them back through Outlook via Logic Apps.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Azure CLI
- Azure subscription
- Agent setup: deploy the latest agent setup using ([this custom deployment](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/use-cases/agents/setup/basic-setup)).
  - The above creates:
    1. AI Services resource
    2. AI Project
    3. Model deployment 
- Bing Grounding resource
- Logic App for sending email

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your-project-endpoint>" # (https://<your-ai-services-account-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project-name>)
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your-model-deployment-name>"
BING_CONNECTION_ID="<your-bing-connection-id>"
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-azure-subscription-id>"
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="<your-resource-group>"
LOGIC_APP_NAME="<your-logic-app-name>"
TRIGGER_NAME="<your-logic-app-trigger-name>" # e.g. When_a_HTTP_request_is_received
```

3. **Deploy Resources Using Bicep**
```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <your-rg> \
  --template-file bing-logicApp-connection.bicep \
  --parameters \
      bingAccountName="bing-grounding-agent" \
      bingSku="S1" \
      connectionName="bing-grounding-conn" \
      accountResource="<AI-Project-Name>" \
      logicAppName="<your-logic-app-name>"
```

4. **Run the Agent Script**
```bash
python template.py
```

5. Go to ai.azure.com, choose the same project and go to the Agents playground to find the above agent.
   
   Add the following tools:
   1. File search (internal documents, FAQs, etc.)
   2. Add the Logic Apps tool (Instructions in /assets/logic-app-setup.md)

## Customization Tips
- Modify the system instructions in `template.py` to tailor the agent’s behavior.
- Extend the agent with additional tools or APIs (using OpenAPI spec) for more advanced automation and inbox tracking using logic apps.
- Adjust the Logic App workflow to return more or less detail as needed.

## Security & Best Practices
- **Never commit your `.env` or any file containing real secrets to the repository.**
- Use [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts) for production secrets management.
- Review and follow [Azure best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/).
