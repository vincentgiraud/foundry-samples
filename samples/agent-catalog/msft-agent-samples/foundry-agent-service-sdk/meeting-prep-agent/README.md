# Meeting Prep Agent

## Summary
The **Meetings and Insights Agent** is built using Azure AI Agent Service. It helps users retrieve meeting and call details, attendee lists, and differentiate between internal and external participants by integrating with Azure Logic Apps. The agent also leverages the **Bing Grounding Tool** to provide relevant, publicly available insights about meeting participants.

## Use Cases
1. **Meeting Preparation**: Retrieve upcoming meetings, calls, and attendee lists for a user.
2. **External Participant Identification**: Identify and list external participants in meetings.
3. **Public Insights**: Fetch public information about meeting participants using Bing.
4. Summarize meeting information and help plan ahead.

## Architecture Overview
The system consists of:
- An AI Agent created with Azure AI Agent Service using `gpt-4o` as the base model.
- A Bing Grounding Tool integrated via Azure Bing Account and connected to the agent.
- A Logic App action tool for meeting/event retrieval, integrated via a Python function and Azure Logic App callback.
- Bicep templates to automate provisioning of Azure resources.

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- Azure CLI
- Azure subscription
- Agent setup: deploy the latest agent setup using ([this custom deployment](https://github.com/azure-ai-foundry/foundry-samples/tree/main/use-cases/agents/setup/basic-setup)).
  - The above creates:
    1. AI Services resource
    2. AI Project
    3. Model deployment 
- Bing Grounding resource
- Logic App for meeting/event retrieval

### Steps

1. **Clone the Repository**

2. **Set Environment Variables**
```bash
PROJECT_ENDPOINT="<your-project-endpoint>" # (https://<your-ai-services-account-name>.services.ai.azure.com/api/projects/<your-project-name>)
MODEL_DEPLOYMENT_NAME="<your-model-deployment-name>"
BING_CONNECTION_ID="<your-bing-connection-id>"
SUBSCRIPTION_ID="<your-azure-subscription-id>"
RESOURCE_GROUP_NAME="<your-resource-group>"
LOGIC_APP_NAME="<your-logic-app-name>"
TRIGGER_NAME="<your-logic-app-trigger-name>" # e.g. When_a_HTTP_request_is_received
```

3. **Deploy Resources Using Bicep**
```bash
az deployment group create \
  --resource-group <your-rg> \
  --template-file bing-logicApp-connection.bicep \
  --parameters \
      bingAccountName="bing-grounding-agent" \
      bingSku="S1" \
      connectionName="bing-grounding-conn" \
      accountResource="<AI-Project-Name>" \
      logicAppName="<your-logic-app-name>"
```

4. **Run the Agent Script**
```bash
python template.py
```

## Customization Tips
- Modify the system instructions in `template.py` to tailor the agent’s behavior.
- Extend the agent with additional tools or APIs (using OpenAPI spec) for more advanced meeting analytics or integrations.
- Adjust the Logic App workflow to return more or less detail as needed.

## Security & Best Practices
- **Never commit your `.env` or any file containing real secrets to the repository.**
- Use [Azure Key Vault](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/key-vault/general/basic-concepts) for production secrets management.
- Review and follow [Azure best practices](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/architecture/best-practices/).
