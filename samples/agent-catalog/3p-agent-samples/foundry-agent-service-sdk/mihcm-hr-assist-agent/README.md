## Prerequisites

1. **Azure Subscription**: Ensure you have an active Azure subscription.
2. **Azure CLI**: Install the [Azure CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
3. **Bicep CLI**: Install the [Bicep CLI](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/bicep/install).
4. **Python**: Install Python 3.8 or later.
5. **Dependencies**: Install Python dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.

## Deployment

### Step 1: Configure Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```properties
PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING="<Your AI project key>"
PROJECT_OPENAPI_CONNECTION_NAME="<Connection name of your API key>"
```

### Step 2: Deploy Azure Resources
 - Deploy the resources using the `deploy.bicep` file.
 - Update `PROJECT_CONNECTION_STRING` with the connection string obtained.

### Step 3: Define the API Key 
- Navigate to your AI Project and add your API Key as a custom key in the below format:
```
Ocp-Apim-Subscription-Key: <your key>
```
- Update the `PROJECT_OPENAPI_CONNECTION_NAME` with the connection name you created.

### Step 4: Run the python script
- Use the `template.py` script to interact with the deployed Azure AI Agent and MiHCM APIs.
- Update the `agent_request` value with different requests for the agent.

## Use Cases
