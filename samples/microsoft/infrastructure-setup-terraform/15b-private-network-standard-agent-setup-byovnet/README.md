# Azure AI Agent Service: Standard Agent Setup with E2E Network Isolation with Bring-Your-Own Virtual Network

> **IMPORTANT**
> 
> Class A subnet support is only available in a limited number of regions and requires your subscription id be allowlisted. Please reach out to fosteramanda@microsoft.com if you are interested in getting access. **Supported regions:** West US, East US, East US 2, Central US, Japan East, France Central, [New] Spain Central, [New] UAE North
>
> Class B and C subnet support is already GA and available in all regions supported by Azure AI Foundry Agent Service. No subscription allowlisting is required. Deployment templates and setup steps are identical for Class A, B, and C subnets; Class A remains in private preview solely because of its limited region coverage.
 
## Key Information

**Limited Region Support for Class A Subnet IPs**
- Class A subnet support is only available in select regions and requires allowlisting of your subscription ID. Supported regions: West US, East US, East US 2, Central US, Japan East, France Central, [New] Spain Central, [New] UAE North

**Region and Resource Placement Requirements**
- **All Foundry workspace resources should be in the same region as the VNet**, including CosmosDB, Storage Account, AI Search, Foundry Account, Project, Managed Identity. The only exception is within the Foundry Account, you may choose to deploy your model to a different region, and any cross-region communication will be handled securely within our network infrastructure.
  - **Note:** Your Virtual Network can be in a different resource group than your Foundry workspace resources 

This infrastructure-as-code (IaC) solution deploys a network-secured Azure AI agent environment with private networking and role-based access control (RBAC). It supports scenarios where a customer has a pre-existing virtual network deployed to a workload subscription which is connected to a platform landing zone where the platform components (such as Private DNS Zones) are stored in the same or a separate subscription.

If you wish to deploy a standalone deployment use the [15a-private-network-standard-agent-setup deployment](../15a-private-network-standard-agent-setup/README.md).

## Prerequisites

1. **Active Azure subscription(s) with appropriate permissions**
  It's recommended to deploy these templates through a deployment pipeline associated to a service principal or managed identity with sufficient permissions over the the workload subscription (such as Owner or Role Based Access Control Administrator and Contributor) and infrastructure subscription (Private DNS Zone Contributor). If deployed manually, the permissions below should be sufficient.

  - **Infrastructure Subscription**
    - **Private DNS Zone Contributor**: Needed over the Private DNS Zones to create the required DNS records for the Private Endpoints
  - **Workload Subscription**
    - **Role Based Access Control Administrator**: Needed over the resource group to create relevant role assignments
    - **Network Contributor**: Needed over the resource group to create the Private Endpoints
    - **Azure AI Account Owner**: Needed to create a cognitive services account and project 
    - **Owner or Role Based Access Administrator**: Needed to assign RBAC to the required resources (Cosmos DB, Azure AI Search, Storage) 
    - **Azure AI User**: Needed to create and edit agents

2. **Register Resource Providers**

   Make sure you have an active Azure subscription for the workload that allows registering resource providers. For example, subnet delegation requires the Microsoft.App provider to be registered in your subscription. If it's not already registered, run the commands below:

   ```bash
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.KeyVault'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.CognitiveServices'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Storage'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Search'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.Network'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.App'
   az provider register --namespace 'Microsoft.ContainerService'
   ```

3. Sufficient quota for all resources in your target Azure region

4. Azure CLI installed and configured on your local workstation or deployment pipeline server

5. Terraform CLI version v1.11.4 or later on your local workstation or depoyment pipeline server. This template requires the usage of both the AzureRm and AzApi Terraform providers.

## Pre-Deployment Steps

1. Create a virtual network of sufficient address space. The virtual network should be configured with proper DNS settings to ensure it can resolve the required Private DNS Zones.
  - **Agent Subnet** (e.g., 192.168.0.0/24): Hosts Agent client for Agent workloads 
  - **Private endpoint Subnet** (e.g. 192.168.1.0/24): Hosts private endpoints 
    - Ensure that the address spaces for these subnets do not overlap with any existing networks in your Azure environment or connected on-premises environments.
    
    **Limitations:**
    - Class A subnet support is only available in a limited number of regions and requires your subscription id be allowlisted. Please reach out to fosteramanda@microsoft.com if you are interested in getting access.
        - Regions with class A support: westus, eastus us, eastus 2, and central us

2. Validate that the subnet that will be delegated to the Agents service has been configured for delegation for Microsoft.App/environments. Without this delegation the deployment will fail.

3. Create the Private DNS Zones listed below. Ensure they are linked to the relevant virtual network which will depend on your DNS resolution pattern for Azure.

    - privatelink.cognitiveservices.azure.com
    - privatelink.openai.azure.com
    - privatelink.services.ai.azure.com
    - privatelink.blob.core.windows.net
    - privatelink.search.windows.net
    - privatelink.documents.azure.com

## Template Customization

Note: The following resources will be created automatically for you:
- Azure Cosmos DB for NoSQL  
- Azure AI Search
- Azure Storage
- AI Foundry resource
- Private Endpoints for resources above

### Variables

The variables listed below [must be provided](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/values/variables#variable-definition-precedence) when performing deploying the templates. The file sample-terraform.tfvars provides a sample Terraform variables file that can be used.
- **resource_group_name_resources** - The name of the resource group where the resources created with this template will be depoyed to.
- **resource_group_name_dns** - This name of the resource group where the pre-existing Private DNS Zones have been deployed to.
- **subnet_id_agent** - The Azure resource ID of the subnet that will be delegated to the Agent service. This subnet must be delegated to Microsoft.App/environments prior to deployment of the resources.
- **subnet_id_private_endpoint** - This Azure resource id of the subnet where Private Endpoints created by this template will be deployed.
- **subscription_id_resources** - The subscription ID (ex: 55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555) that the resources created with this template will be deployed to.
- **subscription_id_infra** - The subscription ID (ex: 55555555-5555-5555-5555-555555555555) where the pre-existing Private DNS zones have been deployed to.
- **location** - The Azure region the resources will be deployed to. This must be the same region where the pre-existing virtual network has been deployed to.

## Deploy the Terraform template

1. Fill in the required information for the variables listed in the sample-terraform.tfvars file and rename the file to terraform.tfvars.

2. If performing the deployment interactively, log in to Az CLI with a user that has sufficient permissions to deploy the resources.

```bash
az login
```

3. Ensure the proper environmental variables are set for [AzApi](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/Azure/azapi/latest/docs) and [AzureRm](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/azurerm/latest/docs) providers. At a minimum, you must set the ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID environment variable to the subscription the Foundry resoruces will be deployed to. You can do this with the commands below:

Linux/MacOS
```bash
export ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
terraform apply
```

Windows
```cmd
set ARM_SUBSCRIPTION_ID="YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_ID"
terraform apply
```

4. Initialize Terraform

```bash
terraform init
```

5. Deploy the resources
```bash
terraform apply
```

### Step-by-Step Provisioning Process (main.tf)

1. Create dependent resources for standard setup:
   - Create new Cosmos DB resource
   - Create new Azure Storage resource
   - Create new Azure AI Search resource

2. Create Azure AI Foundry Resource (Cognitive Services/accounts, kind=AIServices)

3. Create account-level connections:
   - Deploy GPT-4o or other agent-compatible model

4. Create private endpoints with DNS resolution for the Azure Resources: Azure Cosmos DB Account, Azure Storage Storage, Azure AI Search, and Azure AI Foundry

5. Create Project (Cognitive Services/accounts/project)

6. Create project connections:
   - Create project connection to Azure Storage account
